hi sir iam priyanka gandi from .net rpa 2nd december batch. i have competed my 3 months training on rpa automation tools i.e., on 
uipath,automation anywhere and blue prism.
we performed automation on rpa challenge website where we dymically filled the form and captured the success rate using these
three different tools.
now currently iam completing my certification courses on agile and uipath course.
these three tools are used to automate bussiness methods easily without any human intervention.
in these tools we create a bot and with the help of this bot we fill the input form dynamically without any human intervention.
